      <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        URL encoding, also known as percent-encoding, is essential in preparing data for transmission in a URL. Here are the key technical aspects:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-gray-700">
        <li><strong>Percent-Encoding:</strong> URL encoding involves converting characters into a format that can be safely transmitted over the internet. Characters are replaced with '%' followed by two hexadecimal digits representing the character's ASCII code.</li>
        <li><strong>Reserved Characters:</strong> Certain characters have special meanings in URLs. These, along with non-ASCII characters, are encoded to avoid confusion.</li>
        <li><strong>Space Character Encoding:</strong> Spaces can be encoded as '+' or '%20' depending on the context, such as in query parameters versus path components.</li>
        <li><strong>UTF-8 Encoding:</strong> Non-ASCII characters are first encoded as UTF-8 byte sequences, and then each byte is percent-encoded.</li>
        <li><strong>Application:</strong> Widely used in query strings of URLs, form submissions, and when embedding data within URLs.</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation Considerations:</strong> Correct encoding is vital to ensure that data is transmitted without loss or misinterpretation, especially in web applications and APIs.</li>
      </ul>

        Understanding URL encoding is crucial for web developers and those working in fields involving data transmission and web application development.

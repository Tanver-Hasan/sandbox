      <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        Generating a public and private key pair is a fundamental aspect of modern cryptography. Here are the key technical aspects of this process:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-gray-700">
        <li><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Common algorithms include RSA, DSA, ECDSA, and more. RSA is widely used due to its simplicity and security.</li>
        <li><strong>Modulus Length:</strong> Key size, typically ranging from 1024 to 4096 bits for RSA. Larger keys offer more security but require more computational resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Key Format:</strong> Keys are often formatted using standards like PKCS#8 for private keys and X.509/SPKI for public keys.</li>
        <li><strong>Encoding:</strong> Key pairs are encoded in PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail) format, which is a Base64 encoding with additional header and footer lines.</li>
        <li><strong>Asymmetric Cryptography:</strong> This technique ensures that the private key remains secret while the public key can be widely distributed.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Considerations:</strong> The strength of a key pair is contingent upon the key size and the algorithm's resistance to cryptographic attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Used in SSL/TLS, digital signatures, secure file transfer, and various authentication mechanisms.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
        Understanding these technicalities is crucial for developers and security professionals in implementing secure cryptographic systems and protocols.

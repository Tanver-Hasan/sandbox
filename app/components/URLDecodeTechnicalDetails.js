      <p className="mt-2 text-gray-700">
        URL decoding is a process used to convert encoded URL components and query strings back to their original form. Here are some key technical aspects:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-gray-700">
        <li><strong>Percent-Encoding:</strong> URLs use percent-encoding to represent characters that are not allowed in a URL, or have special meanings, using a '%' followed by two hexadecimal digits.</li>
        <li><strong>Decoding Process:</strong> The encoded parts of the URL (characters represented by '%XX' where XX are hexadecimal values) are converted back to their original characters.</li>
        <li><strong>Character Set:</strong> URL decoding takes into account UTF-8 character encoding, allowing for a wide range of characters beyond ASCII.</li>
        <li><strong>Space Character:</strong> The plus sign ('+') in URLs is typically decoded back to a space character.</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Effective decoding is crucial for web applications to correctly interpret data received from URLs, especially in query strings.</li>
        <li><strong>Applications:</strong> Used in web browsers, APIs, and server-side processing to ensure that transmitted data in URLs is accurately represented and understood.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
        Developers working with web technologies and data transmission need a clear understanding of URL decoding to manage data transfer efficiently.
